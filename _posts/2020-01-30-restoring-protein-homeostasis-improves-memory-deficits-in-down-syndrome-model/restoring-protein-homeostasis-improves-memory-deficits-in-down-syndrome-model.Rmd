## General topic : Restoring protein homeostasis improves memory deficits in Down syndrome model


## Intoduction

In this article was examined  the role protein homeostasis networks play in Down syndrome to be more precise the role of the ISR protein. we know that down's syndrome creates a long term memory defects to its victims  Costa-Mattioli and his colleagues investigated whether the activation of the ISR mediated the long-term memory deficits in Down syndrome mice.

## Procedure/                what was 

Researchers have found out that there is a certain protein known as ISR (integrated stress response) which is switched off in people having down syndrome and  could be a major reason for the cognitive deficits 
 To answer this question, Dr costa-Mattioli and his colleages used four independent genetic and pharmacological manipulations to correct the ISR in the Down syndrome mouse model.
Firstly, in one set of experiments they trained Down syndrome and control mice in a new task. Down syndrome mice did not learn the task as well as control mice. Secondly, when they genetically or pharmacologically inhibited the ISR, the animals were able to learn almost as well as control mice."
 

## Conclusions/ discovery	

I can conclude that ISR is the main protein responsible for down syndrome memory defects and from these amazing experiment we can say that switching this protein on in down syndrome peoples will cure memory defects

## Remaining questions
